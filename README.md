Initially I was very inspired by the film photos that I wanted to include which guided a lot of design choices. I created a color palette that encompassed the warm feel of the photos and used a font that was bold and complementary. 

For my navigation structure I followed what I wanted to do in my initial wireframes. I created a horizontal sticky navbar on the left side of the site. The sticky navbar is where I used JavaScript in my portfolio. Another navigation feature is the large Eastside button on the work page that brings you to my case study. 

For the layout of the site, I used CSS grids. It took me a very very very long time to finally get the grids correct, I tried many different numbers and values. I think part of my problem was that Dreamweaver was confusing me but, the thing that matters now is that I figured it out. 

For a lot of the content on the page I created images in InDesign and put them into the site. This approach worked best for me because I had big dreams for my portfolio but limited coding abilities. 

Throughout this process I learned a lot about CSS styling and worked on limiting the amount of code that I must have. For example, instead of styling every image individually I styled them altogether.
